# My Personal NeoVim Setup

### Notes:

On windows:
- LSP will need CLANG installed and in your PATH
  - Solution: Install Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/install) and run `choco install llvm`
- Telescope search grep will need ripgrep (https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
- Terminal will need a compatible font for icons (check https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
